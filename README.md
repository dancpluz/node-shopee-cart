## 📚 About

This project was developed as part of the **Digital Innovation One (DIO)** mobile developer bootcamp. The original goal was to create a shopping cart simulation using plain JavaScript.

As a personal challenge, I decided to expand the project's scope, turning it into a **fully interactive command-line application (CLI)**. To achieve this, I used **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, adding navigable menus and colorful console output for a better user experience, along with a more robust project structure. The idea was to solidify programming logic concepts and learn more about the Node.js ecosystem.

## 📌 Features

  - ✅ **Add Items**: Add new products to the cart by providing a name, price, and quantity.
  - 🛒 **View Cart**: See all items in your cart, with subtotals and the total purchase price.
  - 🔄 **Manage Items**: Increase, decrease, or remove specific items from the cart.
  - 🗑️ **Clear Cart**: Empty the entire cart with a single command.
  - 🎨 **Friendly Interface**: Interaction is handled through simple menus, and the terminal output is colored and uses emojis for better readability.

## 🛠 Built With

  - **Node.js**: Runtime environment for server-side JavaScript.
  - **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the code.
  - **Prompts**: A library for creating interactive and user-friendly command-line prompts.
  - **ts-node**: To run TypeScript code directly without a separate compilation step.
